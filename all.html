                    A considerably large project start the second I got out of school. I was always curious abot how companies worked, and wanted to know. Thus an app was born.
                    By scraping the web, my algorithm finds the employees of a company, and then structures them into an estimate of said company's organizational structure. Currently there is a limit of 1000 employees for a company to work,
                    but if I ever returned to the project, I might grow this value. <span style="color:red">*Please note this repository is private, however you may access the api and web app for free, at <a href="https://structuresearch.herokuapp.com">structuresearch.herokuapp.com</a></span>

                    A smaller project written in roughly 4 hours. My school started restricting certain youtube videos, so I went to work.
                    A funny bonus when I had finished, is that my extension actually skips youtube's ads. My first experience writing a chrome extension, I might add.

Using google's speech recognition, and pytts (text-to-speech) I wrote a jarvis-like project, that's easily programmable to whatever you need it to do. For those who don't know iron man (jarvis), think of this like an Artificial Intelligence assistant.
