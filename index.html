                    In my opinion, maybe even better than the actual project, <a href="https://github.com/CalderWhite/sword-smith-now">Sword Smith Now</a> it was really fun to make, and quite cool since it used many different interesting python utilities.

                    Now <bold>this</bold> is cool. Using google's speech recognition, and pytts (text-to-speech) I wrote a jarvis-like project, that's easily programmable to whatever you need it to do. For those who don't know iron man (jarvis), think of this like an Artificial Intelligence assistant.

                    Woah, this was a while ago. I wrote this as sort of a first <italics>real</italics> project. It's a small video game, but the premisis was that it had an api and could easily be developed for.
