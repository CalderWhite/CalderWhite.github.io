                <h2>Sword Smith Now</h2>
                <p>
                    A fun game I wrote around January. It's based off the idea of unlimited mmo possibilities.

                <p>
                    In my opinion, maybe even better than the actual project, <a href="https://github.com/CalderWhite/sword-smith-now">Sword Smith Now</a> it was really fun to make, and quite cool since it used many different interesting python utilities.

                <h2>SJAM Analytics</h2>
                <p>
                    An interesting little project, that used the grade/mark data posted on my <a href="https://mrjtaylor.weebly.com">highschool math teacher's website</a> to calculate averages and such (in javascript or python).

                    Now <bold>this</bold> is cool. Using google's speech recognition, and pytts (text-to-speech) I wrote a jarvis-like project, that's easily programmable to whatever you need it to do. For those who don't know iron man (jarvis), think of this like an Artificial Intelligence assistant.

                    Woah, this was a while ago. I wrote this as sort of a first <italics>real</italics> project. It's a small video game, but the premisis was that it had an api and could easily be developed for.

                    This project, will essentially write your resume for you. It takes all your github repositories (you may choose public,private or all), gathers the basic info on them and generates a document containing all this work.

                <p>
                    VERY small side project that converts text into an image, and vice versa. The name is inspired by the word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganography</a>.

                    I'll quote the repo description. "Free, easy image sharing using c9.io" Essentially, this is free image sharing, with no strings attached!
